# Campus Marketplace
## The only platform for students to connect with each other through services. 
We are four high school seniors from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology who want to revolutionize the college experience. 

## Idea
College is expensive. Millions of students are forced to take loans, however, life goes on and students still have to pay for expensive services such as a haircut and food delivery. Campus Marketplace creates a hub for students to earn money by providing services and save money by finding services at a cheaper price. Addtionally, when at college, students are forced to getting good grades and research to fulfil their passions. Campus Marketplace give students a place to explore their passions to another dimension by providing services related to their field of intrests. 

Unfortunately, statistics show that a lot of physical, sexual, and mental harrassment occurs on college campuses and we did not want our platform to be used maliciously, so we made sure that users who post inappropriate things would be reported to the site administrators and later, if found guilty, would be banned from the website and reported to the college administrators.

Only college students can use this platform as a .edu email is necessary and the information presented on the platform once signed in would only be revelant to their college.

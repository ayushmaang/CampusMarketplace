# Campus Marketplace
## The only platform for college students to connect with each other with services.
### We are Kashyap Addanki, Rithik Yelisetty, Ayushmaan Ganotra, and Akshith Peyalla, four seniors from Thomas Jefferson High School and Technology. 
### As we enter college and see our siblings in college, we realized how stressful it can be sometimes especially during seasons like finals week. Other times, they just need rest and relaxation to rejuvenate from course work. That is where Campus Marketplace comes in. Using Campus Maretplace, students can request services, like having someone deliver food or giving them a ride, or can help fufill requests which can be used not only to get a little bit of extra cash, which is helpful for their pending college loans, but also can be used to improve their resume, if the services they provide relate to their field of interests.
#### Unfortunately, statistics show that a lot of physical, sexual, and mental harrassment occurs on college campuses and we did not want our platform to be used maliciously, so we made sure that users who post inappropriate things would be reported to the site administrators and later, if found guilty, would be banned from the website and reported to the college administrators.
#### Only college students can use this platform as long as they have a .edu email and the information presented on the platform once signed in would only be revelant to their college.
